# FRP-LWGraphics
Implementations of the Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) Domain-Specific Language (DSL) in Haskell and Racket.

This implementation follows the stream-based approach towards defining FRP constructs as outlined in the paper "Functional Reactive Programming from First Principles" [(paper link)](https://doi.org/10.1145/349299.349331)
